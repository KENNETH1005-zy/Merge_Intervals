# Solution: Merge Intervals
Let's solve the Merge Intervals problem using the Merge Intervals pattern.

## Statement
We are given an array of closed intervals, intervals, where each interval has a start time and an end time. The input array is sorted with respect to the start times of each interval. For example, intervals = 

[ [1,4], [3,6], [7,9] ]
 is sorted in terms of start times1, 3, and 7.
 # Solution: Insert Interval
Let's solve the Insert Interval problem using the Merge Intervals pattern.

## Statement
Given a sorted list of nonoverlapping intervals and a new interval, your task is to insert the new interval into the correct position while ensuring that the resulting list of intervals remains sorted and nonoverlapping. Each interval is a pair of nonnegative numbers, the first being the start time and the second being the end time of the interval.

# Solution: Interval List Intersections
Let's solve the Interval List Intersections problem using the Merge Intervals pattern.

## Statement
For two lists of closed intervals given as input, intervalLista and intervalListb, where each interval has its own start and end time, write a function that returns the intersection of the two interval lists.
